Need to autogenerate approach for documenting what we can do with
this.  See also demo.lisp and TODO.lisp for examples and current
challenges.


Simple reference:


(make-matrix)  instantiates any supported matrix type:
	         = lisp/foriegn
		 = single/double/complex-single/complex-double/integer

(mref mat x y) get/set

(bind2 mat1 mat2 :by [:row|:column] )

(diagonal mat)

(m* mat1 mat2) => selection of the correct ZYYmm type (gemm for general mat mult)
(m+ mat1 mat2)
(m- mat1 mat3)
(axpy a mat1 mat2) => (scalar * matrix) + matrix
